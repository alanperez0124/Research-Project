1. In our paper, the 2-opt method is said to exchange customers from part 1 
    and part 2. So how are we meant to implement it in our simulated 
    annealing algorithm??

    So we can create a condition statement that checks to see if our Part 2
    has anything in it besides -1. Then based on this, 

2.  


NOTES
- We don't have to worry about parts 3 and 4 having 0 in the vectors 
  because they use indexing which seems to start at 1. The significance is
  that when looking at soln.anPart1(iReconveneIndex), we don't have to add 
  +1 inside the parenthesis. 

- It is my belief that we don't need to calculate the departure time of the 
  drone because that all depends on whether the truck gets there first or 
  second.
