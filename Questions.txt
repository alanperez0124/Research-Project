1. When inserting our customer into the truck position and we get our s_prime, 
    do we get another s_prime when we insert our customer into the drone 
    route and compare those as well?? Or what do we dooooo? Right now I have 
    it as two separate solutions. 


2.  When it says remove the assigned customers from the list, does it mean 
    remove jCust from the sorted list?


3. How are we meant to terminate the while loop of he ECA heuristic?

4. 


NOTES
- We don't have to worry about parts 3 and 4 having 0 in the vectors 
  because they use indexing which seems to start at 1. The significance is
  that when looking at soln.anPart1(iReconveneIndex), we don't have to add 
  +1 inside the parenthesis. 

- It is my belief that we don't need to calculate the departure time of the 
  drone because that all depends on whether the truck gets there first or 
  second.
