Heuristic approach to a truck and drones model for last-mile delivery. 
We consider the problem of truck and drone delivery scheduling, following work done by Moshref-Javadi et al.  
Given a depot location and a set of customer locations, the goal is to determine which customers should be served by a 
truck and which should be served by drones that depart and return to the truck.  Moreover, the schedule must specify the 
customer visitation order for the truck and the departure and rendezvous stops for the drones.  We present preliminary results 
from a heuristic algorithm with the goal of minimizing the total customer waiting time.
